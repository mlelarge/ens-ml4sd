# ENS course: Machine Learning for Scientific Discovery: From Foundations to Applications

Marc Lelarge and Tony Bonnaire

This course introduces the foundations of machine learning, from statistical models to modern deep learning, with a focus on practical applications in scientific research. Students will learn core methods, computational tools, and workflows to apply machine learning techniques to data and problems in their own field of study.

After completing the core curriculum, each department will supervise (over a six-week period) the projects it has proposed. The purpose of the core curriculum is to provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of statistical learning, along with the essential computing skills (sklearn â€“ PyTorch) required across all projects.
